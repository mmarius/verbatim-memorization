While the report described that the model was trained using a combination of first supervised learning on a large dataset, then reinforcement learning using both human and AI feedback, it did not provide details of the training, including the process by which the training dataset was constructed, the computing power required, or any hyperparameters such as the learning rate, epoch count, or optimizer(s) used. The report claimed that \"the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models\" were factors that influenced this decision. [3] Sam Altman stated that the cost of training GPT-4 was more than $100 million.[47] News website Semafor claimed that they had spoken with \"eight people familiar with the inside story\" and found that GPT-4 had 1 trillion parameters.[48] Alignment[edit] According to their report, OpenAI conducted internal adversarial testing on GPT-4 prior to the launch date, with dedicated red teams composed of researchers and industry professionals to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.[49] As part of these efforts, they granted the Alignment Research Center early access to the models to assess power-seeking risks.

When contacted to verify or dispel these new stories, X said they were true, all of it was true – that she’d been born a thousand times, that she was the child, the sister, the anything of anyone who said she was such.

For example, keywords on a function definition must\\nbe some subset of the keywords on the declaration; keywords on a type\\ndeclaration must be some subset of the keywords on the definition. This would\\nallow authors to choose when they expect keywords will be most relevant.\\nHowever, it could also serve to detract from readability: two functions in the\\nsame file might be declared similarly, but have different keywords on the\\ndefinition, implying a difference in behavior that would not exist.

But her \"fly-on-the-wall approach\" did not go down well with some church officials.\\n\\n\"The whole attitude towards photographers - there\\'s an awful lot of snobbery about it. You just become a pariah,\" she says.\\n\\nVicars get \"stressed and precious\" about documents being signed correctly.\\n\\n\"On occasion, you get treated like a third class citizen\" and in a \"patronising, off-hand manner\", she says.\\n\\nThat being said, Lorna believes there are a lot of unprofessional photographers doing wedding jobs now.\\n\\nBut her plea to vicars is simple. \"Don\\'t tar everyone with the same brush.\"\\n\\n\"There are lots of very, very fine vicars,\" Lorna adds - and she wants to be clear not all clergy make things awkward.\\n\\n\"In this Instagram age, people all want this dream princess wedding in this church,\" she says. \"I think that leaves a bad taste in the vicar\\'s mouth. When the photographer comes along, that\\'s the final nail in the coffin.\"\\n\\nWhen Paul and Lorraine married in 1995, the vicar was in a \"foul mood\".\\n\\n\"He warned the photographer previously that they could take one photo only in the church and not in the aisle,\" Paul says.\\n\\nWhen the photographer took their sole permitted photograph, the vicar paused the ceremony and \"stared the photographer down for a full 10 seconds\".\\n\\n\"It was awkward to say the least,\" he says.\\n\\nFor Peter and Suzanne Heron, who got married in Newton Abbot, Devon, in 1973, the problem was the other way around.\\n\\n\"There was a point I had to remind the photographer that it was our day, not his,\" Peter says.\\n\\n\"We were talking to people and they kept grabbing us. They wanted to take a photograph here and there.\\n\\n\"In the end we had to remind them, this is our day and we want to enjoy it. But they did a good job.\"',\n",

It’s being pulled away from watching the frost melt on the living room window to make stovetop hot cocoa from a packet, and that last tight hug at the end of the airport security line, and packing up cardboard boxes, knowing I’ll always have what I need, no matter how much I leave behind.\\n\\nWhenever any of us had a negative emotion, it only made things worse. She turned it around on us, and we'd end up apologizing for being hurt or angry or sad, and I never knew what was right or normal. I mean, everyone who met my mom loved her. Teachers, the other parents, my friends. If she wants to, she can make you feel like the center of the universe, like her favorite. I used to love having friends over, because she'd turn into this different person. The funny, warm mom who loved me.\\n\\n“You kissed me.” His brow shoots up. “I thought that was what you wanted. I thought that’s what we were doing.” “No, I know.” I step back, my spine meeting the side of the bench seat. “We were. I just—it’s different now.” “What do you mean?” “I don’t want to play that game anymore,” I say. “I don’t want you to say things you don’t mean and do things you don’t want to do. It’s confusing.” “Who says I did anything I don’t want to do?” he asks. “You did,” I fire back. “You’re the one who told me you don’t want anything to happen between us—” “I never said that,” he argues, stepping closer. “—and I don’t want to be a prop to make your ex jealous, and I know I started it—” “You’re not a prop,” he says, looking hurt. “That’s exactly what I just was,” I counter. “You only want to kiss me when they’re there to see it.

Differently, on October 9th (panel d), before the GRB occurrence, as expected the H ﬁeld reaches its maximum value, but, around 13:21 UT, in coincidence with the occurrence of the ﬁrst peak of the GRB (vertical black dashed line), instead of remaining stable, starts to ﬂuctuate with a low frequency of 0.35 mHz. Interestingly, such alteration lasted up to 19:00 UT, possibly sustained by the hard GRB221009A long tail (Fig. 2), containing more than 10% of the total energy of the prompt emission.\\nIn conclusion, the unprecedented photon-ﬂux associated to the GRB221009A deeply impacted on the Earth’s ionospheric con- ductivity, causing a strong perturbation not only in the bottom side ionosphere13,14, where it is typically observed using ground VLF antennas53, but also in the top-side ionosphere (at around 500 km). In fact, a huge variation of the ionospheric electric ﬁeld, induced by the strong ionospheric conductivity change was detected in the top side ionosphere (507 km) as a consequence of a GRB impact, which increased the ionospheric plasma density by the huge photo- ionization (even in the dayside), as depicted in Fig. 5. The analytical model described in this work supports the observations and conﬁrms the hypothesis that the interaction between GRB and top-side iono- sphere is a threshold process1,4,44. Our model suggests that such a threshold strictly depends on both the production-to-loss-rate ratio of ions and the time duration of the ionization process.\\nAs a closing remark, we want to highlight that, differently to previous similar studies13 focused on the impact of GRB on both D- and F- regions by using TEC data6,43 and/or VLF ground electromagnetic transmitters1,4,14, our work represents, at our knowledge, the ﬁrst-ever\\n4\\nArticle\\n08/10/2022 13:00 UT - 14:00 UT\\nFig. 5 | TEC map over Europe during the GRB',\n",

In the process of green synthesis, a natural extract such as microorganisms and/or plant extracts is harnessed as an environmentally sustainable alternative reducing and capping agent. Consequently, the resulting NPs are devoid of any remnants of organic solvents or toxic chemicals, rendering them inherently eco-friendly when introduced into the environment. This approach offers a distinct advantage over conventional methods, due to its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, environmental friendliness, and relative reproducibility18–22.\\nBased on several studies, green synthesis presents an alternative and promising approach to produce NPs that are safer, with reduced chemical toxicity, benefiting both human health and the environment23–26. Jayarambabu et al. aimed to synthesize ZnO NPs using Lawsonia inermis leaf extract and explore their potential toxicological impacts. The histopathological assessment revealed the safe use of biosynthesized ZnO NPs, confirming their non-toxicity and compatibility with biological systems, thus indicating their promise in the treatment of various diseases. This study conclusively establishes the harmlessness of the biogenic production of ZnO NPs on all vital organs27. Moreover, early literature has shown that, compared to conventionally produced NPs, biosynthesized ZnO NPs significantly suppress both bacterial and fungal diseases28. Furthermore, a recent review lends support to the utilization of environmentally-friendly produced ZnO NPs as feed additives, highlighting their potential to enhance immunity against viral infections24. ZnO NPs derived from natural resources have received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They are classified as “GRAS,” which stands for “Generally Recognized As Safe.”29. Rashidian et al.23 conducted a study to assess the toxicological effects of green synthesized versus commercial ZnO NPs on the immune responses within the skin mucus of carp. The results of this investigation revealed that green ZnO NPs exhibited significantly reduced immunosuppressive effects on important components of fish skin mucus. These green NPs hold immense promise for a wide range of applications in the realms of biology, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. In the future, they have the potential to significantly enhance ecological protection and conservation efforts30,31.\\nThis study presents a green synthesis approach for the production of ZnO photocatalysts, designed to',\n",

A component of a derived type may be declared to be of an enum type. The enumerators are just as in Fortran 2018. The name of the type and the names of its enumerators have exactly the same scoping rules as have other types and constants; for example, a procedure that contains the above declaration must not contain a real variable called spring.\\nNote that a scalar object of an enum type is not an integer but interoperates with a C integer that may have a value or be undefined. It is convenient to refer to this as the ‘integer value of the object’. For an enumerator, the integer value was provided in the enumeration definition. The intrinsic function int is extended to allow its main argument a to be of enum type and return its integer value. An ‘enum constructor’ of the form type-name(expr ), where expr is a scalar integer expression or a boz constant, provides the object of enum type type-name that has integer value expr. For example, season(7) has the value summer. Values that represent no enumerator are permitted as long as they can be represented in the corresponding C integer type. An enum constructor whose expr is constant may appear in a data statement.\\nAn integer expression is said to ‘in type conformance’ with an enum type if it contains a primary that is an enumerator of the type. In an assignment statement with a variable (left-hand side) of an enum type, the expression (right-hand side) must be of the same enum type or an integer expression that is in type conformance with it, for example\\nThe intrinsic operations ==, /=, <, <=, >, and >= are available when both operands are objects of the same enum type or one is of enum type and other is an integer expression that is in type conformance with it.

       " 'DNA polymerase (DNAP) can correct errors in DNA during replication by proofreading, a process critical for cell viability. However, the mechanism by which an erroneously incorporated base translocates from the polymerase to the exonuclease site and the corrected DNA terminus returns has remained elusive. Here, we present an ensemble of nine high-resolution structures representing human mitochondrial DNA polymerase Gamma, Polγ, captured during consecutive proofreading steps. The structures reveal key events, including mismatched base recognition, its dissociation from the polymerase site, forward translocation of DNAP, alterations in DNA trajectory, reposi- tioning and refolding of elements for primer separation, DNAP backtracking, and displacement of the mismatched base into the exonuclease site. Alto- gether, our ﬁndings suggest a conserved ‘bolt-action’ mechanism of proof- reading based on iterative cycles of DNAP translocation without dissociation from the DNA, facilitating primer transfer between catalytic sites. Functional assays and mutagenesis corroborate this mechanism, connecting pathogenic mutations to crucial structural elements in proofreading steps.\\nMaintaining ﬁdelity of replication of genetic information is among the most critical functions of living organisms. Errors arise as a result of DNA damage but also owing to the occasional incorporation of incorrect (non-cognate) substrates, resulting in mismatched base pairs and potentially deleterious mutations1. Cells have evolved sophisti- cated mechanisms to ﬁx these errors2; among them is the ability of DNAP to correct the mismatched bases during DNA replication by a proofreading activity3–5. Proofreading employs an intrinsic exonu- cleolytic activity present in DNAP, or the exonucleolytic activity of auxiliary factors6,7. The former is observed in the Pol A family of DNAPs, which includes bacterial DNA Polymerase I, bacteriophage T7 DNAP, and human mitochondrial DNAP Polγ4,8–12. The N-terminus of these polymerases harbors an exonuclease domain capable of excision of a terminal nucleotide in a canonical metal ion-dependent reaction13. The exonuclease (exo) site is located ~35 Å away from the polymerase (pol) site, with no direct path between them. Therefore, it remains unclear how the misincorporated nucleotide in the nascent DNA can be transferred into the exo site, what triggers the primer separation from the template strand, and how the corrected terminus returns to the pol site after the cleavage6,14,15. One of the hypotheses is based on an intermolecular model, which postulates that upon incorporating a\\nnon-cognate base, DNAP dissociates and rebinds the mismatched primer in the exo',\n",

Anyone who was ever fortunate enough to be a part of X’s life had to accept this hazard – she lived in a play without intermission in which she’d cast herself in every role.\\n\\nThat was the first reason X refused to authorize a biography: it would necessarily be false, and this work of falsehood could only serve to enrich whatever writer was shallow enough to capitalize on her infamy.

       " 'increasing the cost of not consuming the product.12 An example of such technology is the case of the “green bubble” messages on iPhones, which make it salient for iPhone users when they exchange text messages with non-iPhone users. From Equation (2), it is clear that such a technology would increase demand D(p, X) by reducing ui(0, X), pushing up the producer’s revenues.\\nConsumption Spillovers and Network Effects. Negative consumption spillovers to non-users mean that a larger network size decreases non-consumer surplus. In other words, the larger the network, the more costly it is to stay out or to leave the network. For this reason, negative consumption spillovers to non-users intensify the strength of network effects because they increase the cost of non-consumption. To see why, we write network effects as:\\nNote that this expression increases as the term ∂ui(0, X)/∂X becomes more negative. In words, more negative consumption spillovers to non-users imply that network effects become more positive, all else equal. Hence, the presence of more negative consumption spillovers to non-users implies that fewer early adopters are needed to transition to a given equilibrium (see Appendix A) – or, alternatively, the same number of early adopters results in larger subsequent product penetration.\\nThe relationship between the network size and non-consumer surplus has important implications for optimal policy. While in models without consumption spillovers a larger\\n12Alternatively, producers can deepen the negative consumption spillovers; i.e., make ∂ui(0, X)/∂X more negative. If we assume that the technology has no impact when no one uses the product, then the technology also decreases non-consumer surplus for any X.\\nnetwork increases individuals’ welfare, the relationship between the size of the network and welfare is ambiguous when negative consumption spillovers to non-users are present. As can be seen in Equation (1), a larger network size (holding price constant) has two effects on welfare: it changes product market surplus among consumers and non-consumer surplus among non-consumers. With large enough negative consumption spillovers to non-users, if product market surplus among consumers does not increase enough, a larger network size decreases welfare. In this case, anti-trust law or regulatory action to reduce the size of networks (e.g., a Pigouvian tax that increases with network size, as suggested by Romer (2019)) may be welfare-improving.\\nCollege Student Sample.

In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[17] When instructed to do so, GPT-4 can interact with external interfaces.[19] For example, the model could be instructed to enclose a query within <search></search',\n",

However, our findings\\n46It is worth highlighting that among iPhone owners only 8% prefer to live in a world without iPhones,\\nwhile among respondents not owning the iPhone this fraction is 49%.\\nshow that such measures do not accurately reflect welfare in settings with consumption spillovers to potential non-users. Consequently, we introduce a new method to gauge welfare in these contexts, which we apply to widely used social media platforms through large-scale incentivized trials involving college students. While traditional measures of individual consumer surplus suggest positive welfare, the Product Market Valuation that it reveals negative factors in consumption spillovers to non-users tells a different story: welfare, with a notable portion of users experiencing a net disutility from the platform.\\nOur theoretical framework introduces the concept of product market traps, a phe- nomenon whereby consumers find themselves trapped in an inefficient market equilibrium and prefer the product not to exist, but cannot coordinate to stop using it. Intriguingly, such product market traps can arise even with fully rational expectations and without any behavioral frictions. In the context of social media, our empirical evidence highlights the existence of a social media trap for a large fraction of consumers, who derive large individ- ual consumer surplus but, simultaneously, experience negative welfare from the product. These results could help reconcile the seemingly contradictory findings in the social media literature of a large consumer surplus coexisting with negative effects on well-being. More generally, these findings challenge the standard revealed-preference argument that the mere existence of a product implies that its consumers derive positive welfare. The presence of product market traps underscores the need for more research on whether companies intro- duce features that exacerbate non-consumer surplus and diminish consumer welfare, rather than enhance it, increasing people’s need for a product without increasing the utility it delivers to them.\\nOur framework also highlights a few important levers for policymakers: first, policy- makers should regulate markets to counteract producers’ incentives to use technologies that decrease non-consumer surplus. Second, given that larger networks decrease non-consumer surplus, optimal anti-trust policy may involve reducing the size of networks.\\nAlevy, Jonathan E, John A List, and Wiktor L Adamowicz, “How can behav- ioral economics inform nonmarket valuation?

The physical effect caused by the electron loss process is to delay the response of the changes in electron density ρe to changes induced by the photo-ionization process. As a consequence ΔtGI should represents the time taken for the ionospheric photo- ionization recombination processes to recover the equilibrium after an increase of irradiance.

       " 'is weakly aperiodic if it admits a tiling but does not admit a strongly periodic tiling, and strongly aperiodic if it admits a tiling but does not admit a weakly periodic tiling.\\nAny finite set of polygons in the plane that admits a weakly periodic edge-to-edge tiling also admits a strongly periodic tiling [GS16, Theorem 3.7.1], and a similar but simpler argument shows the same to be the case for a finite set of poly-T -tiles where T is itself a strongly periodic tiling and the weakly periodic tiling consists of copies of the tiles all aligned to the same un- derlying copy of T, instead of being edge-to-edge. Thus in such contexts it is not necessary to distinguish weak and strong aperiodicity and we refer to tiles and sets of tiles simply as aperiodic. A uniform tiling [GS16, Section 2.1] is an edge-to-edge tiling by regular polygons with\\nvertex-transitive symmetry group; notation such as (3.4.6.4), listing the sequence of regular polygons round each vertex, denotes a uniform tiling. A Laves tiling [GS16, Section 2.7] is an edge-to-edge monohedral tiling by convex polygons with regular vertices (all angles between consecutive edges at a vertex equal) and tile-transitive symmetry group; analogous notation such as [3.4.6.4] is used for Laves tilings, listing the sequence of vertex degrees round each tile, and in an appropriate sense Laves tilings are dual to uniform tilings.\\n2. The hat polykite and its tilings\\nBefore proceeding to the full proof of aperiodicity, we first offer a less formal presentation of the hat, including an explicit construction of a tiling. This section fulfills three goals. First, it offers an abundance of visual intuition, which provides context for the technical machinery that will follow. Second, it gives some sense of our process of discovery and analysis, though it should not be interpreted as an ordered timeline. Third, it includes a few observations that will not be considered further in this article, but which might provide opportunities for future work by others.\\nOne of the authors (Smith) began investigating the hat polykite as part of his open-ended visual exploration of shapes and their tiling properties. Working largely by hand, with the assistance of Scherphuis’s PolyForm Puzzle Solver software (www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/ polysolver.htm), he could find no obvious barriers to the construction of large patches, and yet',\n",

With all the recent attacks, of course, security had tightened everywhere, and you had to have permission or an invitation to enter any building, and I never had such things, as I was no one in particular who was needed nowhere in particular.
